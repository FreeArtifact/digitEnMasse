        <p>A comparative text analysis of Trump's 2017-2020 State of the Union and Trump's 2025 address to a joint session of congress.</p>
        
        <p>I chose to compare Trump's earlier State of the Union speeches with his 2025 address to a joint session of congress in hopes that some magical pattern would appear that demonstrates where it all went so wrong. However, no magic pattern appeared. Instead, I am only more irritated.</p>

        <img src="images/corpus-screenshots/2025Ngram.png" alt=""/>
        <p>Looking at these two lists--and past the oddly-abundant "thank you"--you can see "we" statements taking up the fifth spot in each. I decided to dig further into this. What does Trump think "we" should do? Why does he use "we" so much? Has his use of "we" changed much from one source to the other?</p>

        <p>And it was at this point I thought I'd be interesting to compare his "we" statements between the sources, as well as with his real life actions following these statements. Perhaps I can amass a larger corpus of Trump? I could then answer questions that reach further into the character of Trump's vocabulary and genuine word usage.</p>

    <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
    <p>In my DIGIT 100 class we were all tasked with the completion of two website portfolios. 
        One was to be made from scratch using CSS and HTML–hosted by GitHub pages–and the other 
        was to be made using WordPress. Now, after building the two websites, I am left to 
        compare the two methods.</p>

    <p>When approaching both methods, I can imagine HTML/CSS to seem the more daunting of the 
        two with those loaded pages of weirdly formatted text–tagged, customized, and layered in 
        syntax you could only ever hope to fully grasp. In contrast, WordPress stands tall, and 
        from its beacon hand glows worldwide welcome as the pillar of accessibility. Providing a 
        visual interface to customize, without the need for coding know-how, sounds like a 
        selection shoe-in, but I enjoyed HTML/CSS much more than WordPress. Now–I must admit–I 
        have some experience with the languages, but I find it to be much more intuitive and free: 
        if I want to change a paragraph, then I go to that HTML file and edit the text directly; if 
        I want to add headers, images, etc, then I throw in a header, a div, etc. It just seems 
        easier to me than navigating through hordes of menus trying to find that one setting that 
        may not even exist.</p>

    <p>However, HTML/CSS does have its downsides. One has to build with intent, understand how the 
        elements, hierarchies, etc all interact with each other, and have a grasp of bad habits as 
        opposed to good ones. On the other hand, WordPress allows you to simply section out your page, 
        throw in content, and be done with it–once you get your head around it. Though, for me, 
        getting my head around it was the hardest part.</p>

    <p>Regardless of the kind of person you are, or your level of experience, both methods demand a 
        bit of tenacity, as well as a desire to learn. That is the nature of building a website (in 
        my opinion). There is so much you can do with a website, so many ways to do it, that if you 
        really want to make something you like then you’re going to have to persevere and learn through 
        the hurdles.</p>

    <p>For this GitHub pages website I would love to learn more about website design. I want something 
        pleasing to look at, something that makes people want to come back, something where people 
        enjoy the simple act of looking around. On top of that, I would love to learn things like SASS, 
        JavaScript, and ThreeJS. There is so much one can do with a website that I can’t help but be 
        utterly enraptured by the possibilities alone.</p>
