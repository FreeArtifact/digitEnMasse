        <h3>What are block elements good for?</h3>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
