        <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
        <p>In my DIGIT 100 class we were all tasked with the completion of two website portfolios. 
            One was to be made from scratch using CSS and HTML–hosted by GitHub pages–and the other 
            was to be made using WordPress. Now, after building the two websites, I am left to 
            compare the two methods.</p>

        <p>When approaching both methods, I can imagine HTML/CSS to seem the more daunting of the 
            two with those loaded pages of weirdly formatted text–tagged, customized, and layered in 
            syntax you could only ever hope to fully grasp. In contrast, WordPress stands tall, and 
            from its beacon hand glows worldwide welcome as the pillar of accessibility. Providing a 
            visual interface to customize, without the need for coding know-how, sounds like a 
            selection shoe-in, but I enjoyed HTML/CSS much more than WordPress. Now–I must admit–I 
            have some experience with the languages, but I find it to be much more intuitive and free: 
            if I want to change a paragraph, then I go to that HTML file and edit the text directly; if 
            I want to add headers, images, etc, then I throw in a header, a div, etc. It just seems 
            easier to me than navigating through hordes of menus trying to find that one setting that 
            may not even exist.</p>

        <p>However, HTML/CSS does have its downsides. One has to build with intent, understand how the 
            elements, hierarchies, etc all interact with each other, and have a grasp of bad habits as 
            opposed to good ones. On the other hand, WordPress allows you to simply section out your page, 
            throw in content, and be done with it–once you get your head around it. Though, for me, 
            getting my head around it was the hardest part.</p>

        <p>Regardless of the kind of person you are, or your level of experience, both methods demand a 
            bit of tenacity, as well as a desire to learn. That is the nature of building a website (in 
            my opinion). There is so much you can do with a website, so many ways to do it, that if you 
            really want to make something you like then you’re going to have to persevere and learn through 
            the hurdles.</p>

        <p>For this GitHub pages website I would love to learn more about website design. I want something 
            pleasing to look at, something that makes people want to come back, something where people 
            enjoy the simple act of looking around. On top of that, I would love to learn things like SASS, 
            JavaScript, and ThreeJS. There is so much one can do with a website that I can’t help but be 
            utterly enraptured by the possibilities alone.</p>
